  - Add maven for handling all archives 
    opsi-archive: Storing all generated opsi-packets		($OPSI_REPOS_BASE_DIR)
      dist-private: archive for all not public installer/MSI files  ($DIST_PRIVATE_REPOS)

    Advantage: maven supports all kind of fileaccess (http, sftp, webdatev, smb, ...)
    and we have to to code the up/downloading from the artifacts.

  - Add integration to jenkins (An extendable open source continuous integration server)
    http://jenkins-ci.org/ (Old: http://hudson-ci.org/, http://java.net/projects/hudson/)
 	- a opsi-hudson.sh will be called as a meta builder. This will trigger the normale opsi-builder.sh

  - autoamtially tagging GIT tree, if a new "release" (OPSI_STATUS==release) was created
    - opsi-builder.cfg:
         OPSI_STATUS=[release|beta|integration]  - tells about the build state
	 
    should be done.
